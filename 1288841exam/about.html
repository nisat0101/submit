                Descriptive Essay : A Long Day At The Beach
            Labor day weekend at the beach, families and all of their belongings gather here for the long weekend. It is 1:32pm on Saturday, it is not cloudy but clouds are present. The sun is warm and intensely strong, but there is a pleasant breeze keeping the sun from growing too unbearably hot. The waves are at most 3 feet tall and the ocean water is generally flat. The sand is littered with beach debris such as brown dried seaweed and various forms of trash. No large pieces of trash are apparent though. There are about 4 sets of tire tracks in the sand from lifeguards or beach patrol passing by. There are various forms of shorebirds circling above the ocean. The smell of salt water and sunscreen fill the air.
